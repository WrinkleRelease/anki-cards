# Verbs Card Templates for Japanese

This folder contains the HTML for the card `front`, card `back`, and the CSS `styles` section. 

## Front Features
The `front` contains an input field that asks for the `Reading` of the words, not the meaning. Only one input field per side is supported by Anki. 

The `front` also contains a clickable field with a hint.

## JavaScript
A few JavaScript code blocks embedded in the HTML allow for several fields in my cards to be pulled in as strings, separated, then formatted and displayed back onto the card in tidy little boxes.
