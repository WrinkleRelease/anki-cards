## Front Features
The `front` contains an input field that asks for the `Reading` of the words, not the meaning. Only one input field per side is supported by Anki. 

## Background Images
This card calls, and tiles, a small background `.jpg`. Drop it in your /collections.media folder and it should sync fine with mobile versions of Anki.

## Card Fields
The Radicals `Note Type` contains the following fields
- Radical
- Name
