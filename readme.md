# Anki Card Templates for Japanese

## What is this?
The Anki card templates are styled after [WaniKani](http://www.wanikani.com)'s layout with a few alterations. They are divided into four note types: `radicals`, `kanji`, `vocab`, and `verbs`.

## What's available?
This repository contains the `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript` needed to style the cards, but does not contain the card decks themselves. The deck content for the `radicals`, `kanji`, and `vocab` decks was compiled from the paid @WaniKani service and is not free use. The `verbs` deck is the exception, as I am compiling that myself. Once I complete the deck with all the verbs used in the JLPT exams, I would be happy to offer it here for download.

@[WaniKani](https://github.com/WaniKani), and its parent company, @[Tofugo](https://github.com/tofugu), also host their own GitHub repos for the community to use.
