# Anki Card Templates for Japanese

## What is this?
The Anki card templates are styled after [WaniKani](http://www.wanikani.com)'s layout with a few alterations. They are divided into four note types: `radicals`, `kanji`, `vocab`, and `verbs`.

## What's available?
This repository contains the `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript` needed to style the cards, but does not contain the card decks themselves. The deck content for the `radicals`, `kanji`, and `vocab` decks was compiled from the paid @WaniKani service and is not free use. The `verbs` deck is the exception, as I am compiling that myself. Once I complete the deck with all the verbs used in the JLPT exams, I would be happy to offer it here for download.

@[WaniKani](https://github.com/WaniKani), and its parent company, @[Tofugo](https://github.com/tofugu), also host their own GitHub repos for the community to use.

# Kanji Table Data

Compiled for my own uses, I am uploading a `.csv` compiled from various source. It contains all the kanji taught on WaniKani, tested for across the JLPT, and taught in school in Japan. Also provided are columns that allow sorting by frequency of use. 

I have not yet cross-referenced this with readings or meanings.
